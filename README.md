## Goal of this repository
Using the [Gesch√§ftspartner suchen](https://github.com/Integra-SUPERB/INTEGRA_Geschaeftspartner-suchen) repository, you can search for an existing business partner. In Switzerland, both natural persons and juridical persons are considered business partners by the Swiss government. The data is managed by a team at the Federal Finance Administration (FFA). A team from the Federal Finance Administration (FFA) manages the master data and ensures that every person only exists once in the database. If a request is approved, a new business partner will be created and also show up through the search function.
